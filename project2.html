       1. Rather than stating vague job titles or responsibilities, use specific examples to showcase your skills and experiences. For example, instead of writing “Worked as a cashier,” you can write “Managed cash transactions, maintained accurate cash drawer, and provided excellent customer service at the front counter.” <br> <br>

       2. McDonald’s values employees who go above and beyond their job responsibilities. If you have accomplished a goal or received recognition, include it in your resume. For instance, if you received employee of the month award or were promoted to a supervisory position, mention it in your resume. <br> <br>

       3. Using action verbs such as managed, led, and initiated will make your work experience section more engaging and impressive. It shows that you were an active participant in your job, and you took the initiative to get things done. <br> <br>

       4. If possible, quantify your achievements to give hiring managers a sense of the scale and impact of your accomplishments. For example, you can mention how much revenue you generated, how many customers you served, or how much inventory you managed. <br> <br>
